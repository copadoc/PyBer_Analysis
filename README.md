PyBer Analysis
	Some of most important aspects of The PyBer Analysis are the in-depth demonstrations of key differences between variables that the analysis provides. For example, in overview, the analysis allows us to explore and find answers to many important answers that a ride-share company might seek; Furthermore, with the analysis we are better able to assess where the company is and where it is heading while also making recommendations based on said analysis.
	In focusing on the data provided by the PyBer Analysis, it is recognizable the correlations of between many of the variables, take for instance the relationship between the number of drivers, total rides, and data among the different city types. When looking at the data, the type of cities greatly dictates the number of drivers and the number of total rides. For example, looking at the chart provided, it demonstrates that in Urban areas, the number of rides and fares are higher as opposed to Rural cities thus translating to a higher number of drivers servicing Urban cities.

In juxtaposition, a clear and key difference between Rural and Urban data is the average fare per ride. In Rural cities, the average fare is much higher than in Urban cities.

	In summary, the recommendations to the company CEO are as follows: The amount of drivers in Urban cities are more than what is needed, if the company is to succeed in rural communities, it can increase the amount of drivers in rural areas which will bring average cost per ride down but it can also increase the amount of rides due to this. In addition, increasing the amount of drivers to suburban areas will also help increase revenue by decreasing the cost per ride. Finally, the company will decrease costs in labor by spreading drivers to each city location to match demand.
